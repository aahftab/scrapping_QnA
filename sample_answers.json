      "(Fatwa: 745/619/B=1432) (1) If the owner of Muslim hotel claims that the meat is halal, his words shall be acceptable. But if you have any doubt due to any reason you can avoid eating it. The ruling of haram shall be applicable if you observe yourself being slaughtered on non-Shariah method. (2) Usually they put chicken in hot water after slaughtering for awhile until the skin softens and gets off easily. It is not right to eat such a chicken that is put in hot water so long that its filth is cooked and its bad smell is absorbed in the meat, thus all the meat gets impure and unclean. Eating such chicken is not right.",
